- can we combine ticket_first_resolution_time_business & ticket_full_resolution_time_business?
- can I write a macro that will take two times and convert from calendar to business hours?



To do:
- create ticket for user historical roles (was this ever mentioned?)
- Cross db compatibility
- agent work time
- historical ticket details
- README
